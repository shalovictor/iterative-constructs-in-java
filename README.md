## Entry Controlled loops

- for loop
- while loop


## Exit Controlled loops

- do-while loop

## break statement

Used to break the loop cycle

## continue statement

skip the execution of a particular iteration of a loop

## Interconversion of Loops

A looping program can be converted to from one form to another
  -for loop to while loop
  -while loop to do while loop
  -do while loop to for loop

## User Controlled Loop

The user can have the controll to execute the Loop
